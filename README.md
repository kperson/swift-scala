# Swift and Scala

Swift and Scala are very similar languages.  On the TallyPix app, we use Swift for iOS and Scala on the backend.  The similarity has kept the cognitive overhead low allowing us to easily switch between Scala and Swift.

This guide is for those who know Swift or Scala and are looking to leverage existing knowledge to learn the other language.

This is not an exhaustive guide of Scala or Swift.  Both languages have unique features and strengths, but this should be a good starting point for your journey!
